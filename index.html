        Bread is not as malleable and adaptable as pasta/noodles, you can make a variety of dishes with them and they come in extremely unique shapes. But bread is <b>that girl</b>: she's stand alone and she doesn't need to be apart of a flashy dish. However, she does come in some variety as well. Let's look at four unique iterations of this iconic food:
